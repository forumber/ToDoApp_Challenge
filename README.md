TodoApp
Software Engineer Challenge Project

Project is available at: https://hub.docker.com/r/forumber/todoappchallenge

1. Build Your App:
In order to build the app, just build the docker image from Visual Studio, or run "docker build"

2. Run your app with dependencies:
After building the docker image or pulling out from the Docker Hub, just run "execute.bat" file available in the repository. If you want to execute it in linux, you need to modify Windows-only commands (such as @ECHO) and turn it into a shell script.

After the execution of script, you can access the application on http://localhost:8080/
